## About Me
⛵️ **Education**: I am a Ph.D. Candidate at the [Data Science and Analytics Thrust](https://dsa.hkust-gz.edu.cn/) (DSA), Information Hub, The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou). I have been gracefully supervised by [Prof. Nan Tang](https://nantang.github.io/) on conducting AI+Data research and co-supervised by [Prof. Yuyu Luo](https://luoyuyu.vip/). 

Before that, I was endorsed a honored bachelor degree in Information Engineering with minor in Computer Science at The Chinese University of Hong Kong in 2020. Then, I worked as a data scientist at [Measurable AI](https://www.measurable.ai/), where I derive consumer insights from transactional data of emerging markets for nearly 4 years.

📚 **Research**: I focus on applied AI/LLM research, including but not limited to: 
- Good Data For AI: data cleaning and transformation, see [MegaTran](https://github.com/HKUSTDial/megatran); 
- Good AI For Fund Investment: Project Leader on [DeepFund](https://github.com/HKUSTDial/DeepFund).

💹 **Entrepreneurship**: I am the founder and CEO of [Paradoox AI](https://paradoox.ai/), a FinTech startup focused on trustworthy AI solutions for fund investment.

💬 I am open to collaboration on any of the above topics, e.g., academic contributions, project consultation, open-source community, peer-review, etc. Please feel free to contact me via email.
