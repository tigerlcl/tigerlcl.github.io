## About Me

I am a Ph.D. student at the [Data Science and Analytics Thrust](https://dsa.hkust-gz.edu.cn/), Information Hub, The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou). 
Currently, I am a member of the [DIAL](https://github.com/HKUSTDial), supervised by [Prof. Nan Tang](https://nantang.github.io/) and co-supervised by [Prof. Yuyu Luo](https://luoyuyu.vip/).
I received my B.Eng degree in Information Engineering (minor in Computer Science) from the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) in 2020.

I was born and raised in Kunming, Yunnan. Then I got enrolled in The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) for my undergraduate study. After graduation, I worked as a Data Scientist @ [Measurable AI](https://measurable.ai/en-US/), a Silicon-Valley-Born AI startup company, for several years. I was gracefully admitted to HKUST(GZ) in Spring 2024.

## Research Interests
I focus on LLM-based Apps. Below are some stunning topics I am working on:
- Good Data For AI: data cleaning and transformation, [MegaTran](https://github.com/HKUSTDial/megatran).
- Good AI For Fund Investment: Project Leader on [DeepFund](https://github.com/HKUSTDial/DeepFund).
